# DSA Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a personal project where I explore and implement various algorithms to deepen my understanding of how they work. The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills while improving my grasp of fundamental concepts.

I will be continually updating this repository with new algorithms and data structures as I progress. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome!
## Data Structures
* ### Linked Lists
    * - [Doubly Linked List(python)](https://github.com/drososdros/dsa-learning/tree/main/data-structures/linked-lists/python/doubly-circular-linked-lists)
* ### Queue
    Circular queue on a predefined size on top of a list
    * - [Circular Queue(python)](https://github.com/drososdros/dsa-learning/tree/main/data-structures/queue/circular-queue.py)


## Tools
* ### DirTree
     a directory printing tool to understand recursion
    * - [Dir printing tool (python)](https://github.com/drososdros/dsa-learning/tree/main/tools/dir-tree/python)
